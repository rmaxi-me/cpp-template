# cpp-template
My C++ projects template :)

Check the [**conan branch**](https://github.com/MaximeHouis/cpp-template/tree/conan) if you would like to use Conan!

## Why

This is my basic structure that I use for my C++ projects. Feel free to use it if you like it.

## How

* Click on the big green `Use this template` button
* You can search for `template:` through files to access main code parts to change depending on your project
* Remove what you don't like
* Add stuff you like
* Do what the f\*ck you want, really

## What

* `.clang-format` for the style
* `.gitignore` to exclude unwanted files/dirs
* GitHub Action workflow to build the project
* CMake configurations, compiler warnings and cool flags
* Unit tests preset (easily removable)
* [**cpp-utils**](https://github.com/MaximeHouis/cpp-utils), a collection of C++ utilities made by me
* [**conan branch**](https://github.com/MaximeHouis/cpp-template/tree/conan) for conan projects *(duh)*
